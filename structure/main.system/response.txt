Sure! Here's the "Hello, World!" program in Bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

This program simply uses the `echo` command to print out the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The first line `#!/bin/bash` is called a shebang and specifies the interpreter to use to run the script (in this case, `/bin/bash`).
